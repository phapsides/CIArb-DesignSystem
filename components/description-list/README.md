A Description List shows a set of key/value pairs, suitable for metadata, summaries and reviews.

Unlike most components, the Description List is made up of two componentsâ€”a parent component that acts as the wrapper for the whole Description List, and a child component that makes up the individual list items. Be aware of this when checking the parameter documentation.

## When to use this component

For showing a list of information as key/value pairs. For example, summarising a user's responses at the end of a form.

## When to consider something else

Only use the Description List for information that has both a key and at least one value.

Do not use for lists or tabular data. Use the appropriate HTML element for those situations.

## Guidance

A list item **must** always have one key and at least one value.

The `wide` variant collapses to a single stacked column on narrower screens.

## Accessibility

The Description List is marked up with `dl`/`dt`/`dd` elements, befitting the semantics of the Description List.

## Browser considerations

None.
